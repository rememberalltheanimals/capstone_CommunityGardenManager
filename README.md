# capstone_CommunityGardenManager
CVTC IT Capstone Team 2 project
Our project will be a website that will allow clients to manage a community garden within their city. This means that a city or person can set up a webpage that can allow users of their website to gain information on any aspects the client would like to display on the site. That can include information such as plots that are available to be used, what times the garden will be open, watering schedules, and plants that would thrive in the environment that the garden is placed in. The basic site will try to include these kinds of information as well to provide an easier time for the client. 

This website will utilize JavaScript, Express, and EJS for the front end portion. This way, the developers can make the web pages more dynamic. The back end of the website will use Node JS and PostgreSQL. The Node JS will help work with the JavaScript framework while the PostgreSQL will serve as the database function.
